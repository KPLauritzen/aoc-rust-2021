# Advent of Code 2021
This is my attempt to solve Advent of Code 2021 in Rust

https://adventofcode.com/2021

## Quick start

There is a file for each day under `/src/bin`.
You can run a specific day with 
```
cargo run --bin day<NN>
```
where `<NN>` is the day. For example
```
cargo run --bin day01
```
will run the program for day 1 and print the answer to the console.
